# Chainlink CCIP: End-to-End Flow Explained

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of how Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) works, including the onchain and offchain components involved at each step. Diagrams are included where necessary for clarity.

## 📦 Components Overview

### **Onchain Components**

- **EOA/Sender**: Initiates a CCIP message.
- **Router Contract**: Entrypoint that emits events and routes messages.
- **OnRamp Contract**: Used for packaging, rate limiting, and storing messages.
- **CommitStore Contract**: Stores signed Merkle roots on the destination chain.
- **OffRamp Contract**: Verifies Merkle proofs and executes transactions.
- **Risk Management Contract**: Blesses or curses messages for safety.

### **Offchain Components**

- **Committing DON (Decentralized Oracle Network)**: Creates and signs Merkle roots.
- **Executing DON**: Verifies Merkle proofs and calls OffRamp.
- **Risk Management Network (RMN)**: Blesses or curses Merkle roots for safety.

## 🧭 End-to-End Message Flow

### Step 1: Message Initiation (Onchain)

- A user (EOA) sends a message to the **Router Contract** on the source chain.
- The Router routes the message to the **OnRamp Contract**, which emits an event.

**Diagram:**

```
EOA → Router → OnRamp → emits event
```

### Step 2: Committing DON - Merkle Root Creation (Offchain)

- Committing DON nodes monitor the **OnRamp** events.
- Wait for **source chain finality**.
- Batch multiple messages → create a **Merkle tree** → sign the **Merkle root**.
- Post the signed Merkle root to the **CommitStore Contract** on the destination chain.

**Diagram:**

```
OnRamp Events ↴
Committing DON: [tx1, tx2, ..., txn] → Merkle Root → CommitStore (dest)
```

### Step 3: Risk Management Network Blessing (Offchain + Onchain)

- RMN nodes monitor the Merkle root in the **CommitStore**.
- Independently reconstruct Merkle root from observed messages.
- If consistent → call **bless()** on the **Risk Management Contract**.
- Once quorum is reached → message is considered safe.

**If anomaly:** Nodes vote to **curse**. If curse quorum reached, execution is paused.

**Diagram:**

```
RMN: observed Merkle root == committed root → bless()
```

### Step 4: Executing DON - Message Execution (Offchain + Onchain)

- Executing DON monitors the **OnRamp** and **CommitStore**.
- Verifies that the message is:
  - Part of the committed Merkle root.
  - Blessed by RMN.
- Builds a Merkle proof → sends it to the **OffRamp Contract**.
- **OffRamp** executes the call (e.g., `ccipReceive()`) on the receiver contract.

**Diagram:**

```
Executing DON ↴
Check Merkle proof + RMN → OffRamp → Receiver Contract
```

## 🔐 Security Layers

- **Rate Limits**: Enforced on OnRamp/OffRamp to prevent abuse.
- **Smart Execution**: Gas-locked pre-paid execution.
- **RMN**: Independent consensus layer for safety.
- **Quorum-Based Signing**: No single point of failure in DON.

## ⏱️ Why It Takes Time

- Finality waiting (on source chain)
- Merkle batching (Committing DON)
- RMN blessing delay
- Executing DON verification + execution

## 🛠️ Optional Checks and Tools

- Estimate fee via `getFee()` on source chain.
- View rate limits in [CCIP Directory](https://ccip.chain.link).
- Use CCIP testnet for dry runs.
